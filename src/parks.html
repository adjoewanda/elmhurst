      <h1>Parks</h1>
      <p>Currently there are five parks and playgrounds in Elmhurst: Hoffman Park, Moore Homestead Playground, Newtown Playground, Crowley Playground, and Elmhurst Park. While it varies depending on the parks, generally the facilities include seating areas and playgrounds for kids. Some also have basketball courts. Constantly crowded with residents and younger children, these timeless parks are certainly one of local favorite hangouts.</p>
