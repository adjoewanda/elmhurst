      <h1>Indonesian Hub</h1>
      <p>Indonesia is a country of tropical islands in Southeast Asia and in the north of Australia. Indonesia is perhaps most known for their famous Bali as a travel destination, their megacity Jakarta, and the Borobudur Temple from The Seven Wonders of The World. One of the hidden gems that only local knows about Elmhurst is that it is also currently the premier Indonesian hub. The Indonesian community is predominantly centered around this neighborhood. Locals and tourists can also get a taste of Indonesian rich and savory cuisine here on a walk on Whitney Avenue.</p>
